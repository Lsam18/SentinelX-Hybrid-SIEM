Hybrid SIEM with Cloud-Local Honeypot Integration
Unified Threat Detection, Automated Response & Analyst Tooling

This project delivers a next-generation Hybrid SIEM solution combining Azure Sentinel, local/cloud honeypots, and SOC-focused tools for modern cybersecurity operations. Key features include:

Hybrid Honeypots: Windows-based local honeypot + Azure cloud honeypot for unified monitoring.

File Integrity Monitoring (FIM): Real-time detection of ransomware/file tampering (Node.js).

Automated Playbooks: Sub-5-second responses (IP blocking, VM isolation).

SOC CSV Analyzer Pro: Offline log analysis with PDF reporting (Python/Streamlit).

Setup Guide
1. Azure Sentinel SIEM Deployment
Prerequisites:

Azure subscription with Sentinel-enabled Log Analytics workspace.

Contributor permissions for resource creation.

Deployment Steps:

powershell
# Create Log Analytics workspace  
New-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspace -ResourceGroupName "SIEM-RG" -Name "Sentinel-Workspace" -Location "EastUS"  
# Enable Sentinel  
New-AzSentinel -ResourceGroupName "SIEM-RG" -WorkspaceName "Sentinel-Workspace"  
Configure Data Connectors:

Enable Windows Security Events (local honeypot), Azure Activity Logs, and Syslog.

Ingest IP-to-Geodata:

kql
.create table GeoIP (IP:string, Country:string, Lat:real, Lon:real)  
2. Local Honeypot + FIM Setup
Deploy the File Integrity Monitor to detect unauthorized file changes:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Lsam18/Sentinel-X.git  
cd Sentinel-X/FIM-Module  
npm install  
node server.js  
Monitors C:\Critical by default (configurable).

Alerts sent to Azure Sentinel via Log Analytics Agent.

3. SOC CSV Analyzer Pro
For offline log analysis and reporting:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Lsam18/ai-soc-summary-SentinelX.git  
cd ai-soc-summary-SentinelX  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
streamlit run app.py  
Features: Statistical analysis, correlation heatmaps, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, and PDF reports.
